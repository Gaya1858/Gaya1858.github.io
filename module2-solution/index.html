                        <p>Mathematics includes the study of such topics as quantity, structure, space, and change.
                            It has no generally accepted definition. Mathematicians seek and use patterns to formulate
                            new conjectures; they resolve the truth or falsity of such by mathematical proof.

                        <p>Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable
                            explanations and predictions about the universe. The earliest roots of science can be traced to
                            Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3000 to 1200 BCE.

                        <p>A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical
                            operations automatically. Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs.
                            These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks.
